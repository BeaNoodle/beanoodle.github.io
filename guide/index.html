        <p>This page no longer meets my standards, as of now (7/25/25) this page will remain until a newer version replaces it. I plan to remake the guide to make it consistent with my main page, umineko.gay.</p>
    
        <section id="Introduction"></section>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Umineko When They Cry is a Japanese murder mystery visual novel, written by Ryukishi07, released in 2007. The plot revolves around a bizarre case of serial murders that take place on the isolated island, Rokkenjima.</p>

        <section id="Official-Releases"></section>
        <h1>Official Releases</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.mangagamer.com/detail.php?product_code=177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MangaGamer</a>/<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/406550/Umineko_When_They_Cry__Question_Arcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>/<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/umineko_when_they_cry_question_arcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOG</a> – The only official release of Umineko outside of Japan (at the moment). The MangaGamer version of Umineko is based off the original PC release, with the added inclusion of entirely new, optional sprites to use in place of the originals.</p>
        <p><a href="https://global.bookwalker.jp/series/75718/umineko-when-they-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manga Adaptation</a> - The manga version of Umineko does an amazing job at adapting the original visual novel into a different medium. The pacing is definitely a lot faster than the original, but you still get the full experience if it’s your only option for reading Umineko. Episodes 7 and 8 in the manga are different than their original visual novel versions, the changes made make it definitely worth the read for preexisting fans too. Just like the original, the manga is long, adapting the episodes in 4 - 9 volumes each.</p>
        <p>Anime Adaptation - Not real, does not exist, there is no love.</p>

        <h1>Fan Translations & Mods</h3>
        <p><a href="https://witch-hunt.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Witch Hunt Translation</a> - This is the first ever English translation of Umineko. This same translation is included in the MangaGamer/Steam version.*</p>
        <p><a href="https://uminekofix.fandom.com/wiki/Tweaking_Umineko_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umitweaks</a> - A PS3 sprite, background, and voices mod for the original PC release of Umineko.*</p>
        <p><a href="https://07th-mod.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">07th-Mod</a> - A PS3, sprite, background, and voices mod for the MangaGamer/Steam release of Umineko. 07th-Mod also has a voice only patch to use with the Ryukishi and Pachinko sprites.</p>
        <p><a href="https://umineko-project.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umineko Project</a> - An open source port of the HD PS3 version of Umineko. Umineko Project includes features not found in 07th-Mod, like animated rain, animated CGS and transition effects, animated mouth flaps, and BGM titles display when tracks are changed. Umineko Project’s translation is entirely new and separate from the Witch Hunt Translation</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/andOlga/umineko-catbox-english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umineko Catbox English Patch</a> - A full translation patch for Umineko: The Symphony of Catbox and Dreams on Nintendo Switch. To use this patch, you need either an unpatched modded Nintendo Switch with Atmosphere, or a Switch Emulator like Yuzu or Ryujinx. This version of the game is identical to the PS3 version, with the added addiction of fully voice acted bonus content, new openings, etc.</p>
        <p>*Both Witch Hunt Translation and Umitweaks are now irrelevant due to newer mods. However, Witch Hunt and UmiTweak both feature animated rain, which broke in the engine change of the MangaGamer release.</p>

        <section id="Choosing"></section>
        <h1>Choosing a Version to Read</h3>
        <p>There are many options for what version of Umineko to actually read. Below, there are 3 sprite styles, clicking on one will show you the diffrent options for reading with the chosen style.</p>
        <p>Currently, this feature is a work in progress, but all the information would be stuff already on this page.</p>
