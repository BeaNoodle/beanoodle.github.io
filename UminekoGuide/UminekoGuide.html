        <p> This site was just thrown together as an easy way to explain the many versions of Umineko (In English) and how they differ from each other. This page is mostly finished, but there are still some things I want to add and tweak. If you have any feedback, changes, or inclusions for me to add to the site, then please don’t be afraid to DM me about it.</p>
        
        <section id="Introduction"></section>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Umineko When They Cry is a Japanese murder mystery visual novel, written by Ryukishi07, released in 2007. The plot revolves around a bizarre case of serial murders that take place on the isolated island, Rokkenjima.</p>
        <br>
        <section id="Official-Releases"></section>
        <h1>Official Releases</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.mangagamer.com/detail.php?product_code=177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MangaGamer</a>/<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/406550/Umineko_When_They_Cry__Question_Arcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> – The only official release of Umineko outside of Japan (at the moment). The MangaGamer version of Umineko is based off the original PC release, with the added inclusion of entirely new, optional sprites to use in place of the originals.</p>
        <p><a href="https://global.bookwalker.jp/series/75718/umineko-when-they-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manga Adaptation</a> - The manga version of Umineko does an amazing job at adapting the original visual novel into a different medium. The pacing is definitely a lot faster than the original, but you still get the full experience if it’s your only option for reading Umineko. Episodes 7 and 8 in the manga are different than their original visual novel versions, the changes made make it definitely worth the read for preexisting fans too. Just like the original, the manga is long, adapting the episodes in 4 - 9 volumes each.</p>
        <p>Anime Adaptation - Not real, does not exist, there is no love.</p>
